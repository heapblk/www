Hi! I'm heapblk, a random dev that is a little too obsessed with C/C++.
That said, plenty of other things capture my interest, 
and I'd like to share them here

NOTE: this entire site is still heavily under development, so expect random 
      changes at any time :)

## Interests
I have a keen interest in programming and systems design, 
especially compiler design, which is what I'm currently focusing on.
Other than that I like:

	- Fighter Jets
	- Tee 
	- Castles
	- Math (or really, anything science related)

### Fighter Jets
Somwhere in the last 2 years, I've developed a love for fighter jets.
I especially like 5th-gen fighters like the F22 Raptor, 
though my favourite plane is, of course, the F14 Tomcat.
			
### Tee
I've found myself drinking a lot of tea recently, and with that, 
I've also developed some specific tastes. I really enjoy all kinds of black tea, 
but I also have a soft spot for fruit teas.
			
### Castles
For a few years now I've been visiting various castles across Europe.
I usually do so during autumn or winter, those seasons really frame the
Castles beautifully. And of course, the history of each one is fascinating.
too.

### Math
This is a more recent development, I've started to get really interested in
Maths and have since annoyed my math-major friends into explaining everything
they can to me :D
