					   That said, many things capture my interest, and I'd like to share some of them here

	<h2 id="tech">## Technology</h2>
	<p class="content">
	I've always been a fan of computers and technology. I believe in reinventing the wheel if it helps you understand how the wheel works. That's why I've recently started to deep-dive into compilers and operating systems, and even started building my own compiler (very much unfinished).
	</p>
	<p class="content">
		Previously, I implemented <a href="https://github.com/heapblk/common">"Common"</a>, an <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Joke_language_list">esoteric joke language</a> and my first step into language design and implementation
	</p>
	<p class="content">
		I've worked on pretty much every domain of software development: frontend, backend, embedded systems, application development, and cybersecurity.<br>
		I built an air-gapped network using some old computers and a router I had lying around to experiment with <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/">OWASP Juice Shop</a> and other exploitable software on physical hardware.<br>
		I'm even managing my own homeserver (which I'm very proud of).
	</p>
	<p class="content">
		Currently, my obsession lies with my own <a href="https://github.com/heapblk/frieren">flight simulator engine thingy</a>.
	</p>
	<h2 id="ttrpg">## TTRPGs</h2>
	<p class="content">
		I love playing all kinds of TTRPGs (Tabletop Roleplaying Games). I've played Cyberpunk 2020, DnD, Kids on Bikes, Call of Cthulhu, Vaesen, and Tales from the Loop. <br>
		When I host my own games, I always like to build my own world and history (I might make a wiki about my world here someday). <br>
		By far, my favourite game to play, though, is Call of Cthulhu, my GM (Game Master) is incredibly good at setting the mood for this Lovecraftian horror game.<br>
	</p>		
	<h2 id="engineering">## Engineering</h2>
	<p class="content">
		I'm quite fascinated by high-performance engineering, especially modern fighter aircraft and motorsport engineering
	</p>		
	<h3 id="fighterjets">### Fighter Jets</h3>
	<p class="content">
		Modern fighter jets are crazy complex, high-performance machines, how could you not fall in love with them
	</p>
	<p class="content">
		For a long time, my favorite jet was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhoi_Su-57">Sukhoi Su-57</a>, solely because of its amazing livery.  
	</p>

	<p class="content" style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin-top:0">Thanks to Wikipedia and Anna Zvereva for taking this amazing picture</p>
	<p class="content">
		Later, I stated that my favorite plane was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grumman_F-14_Tomcat">Grumman F-14 Tomcat</a>, because its sweeping wing design terrified and fascinated me at the same time, and let's be honest, it looked amazing in the new Top Gun movie.  
	</p>

	<p class="content" style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin-top:0">Thanks to Wikipedia and the US Navy for taking this picture</p>
	<p class="content">
		Nowadays, my favorite aircraft is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_F/A-18_Hornet">McDonnell Douglas F/A-18C Hornet</a>. Its versatility is what got me: being able to land on carriers and carry all sorts of air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons. Coincidentally, it's also the jet I primarily fly in DCS. If you ever see me in DCS, feel free to say hi.

	<h3 id="f1">### F1</h3>
	<p class="content">
		I've been an F1 fan since the 2023 season. My favourite F1 team is, of course, whatever team Lewis Hamilton is at :) currently, that's Ferrari.
	</p>		
	<p class="content">
		However, my main interest in F1 is the design and engineering that goes into the cars. I love studying different design choices across teams, looking at legendary designs from the past and learning what made them so good, and watching technical breakdowns of the newest design changes each team brings to the track.
	</p>
	<h2 id="castles">## Castles</h2>
	<p class="content">
		For a few years now, I've been visiting various castles across Europe. I usually do so during autumn or winter, those seasons really frame the castles beautifully. And, of course, the history of each one is fascinating, too.
	</p>		
	<h2 id="otherstuff">## Other stuff</h2>
	<p class="content">
		I think accounting is pretty neat; I've even started helping my parents with their finances and taxes. I've recently been getting back into going to the gym and running. I looove good food, but my love hasn't been enough to get me into cooking yet.
