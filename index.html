	<p class="content">Hi! I'm heapblk, a random dev that is a little too obsessed with C/C++. That said, plenty of other things capture my interest, and I'd like to share them here</p>
	<h2>## Interests</h2>
	<p class="content">
	I have a keen interest in programming and systems design, 
	especially compiler design, which is what I'm currently focusing on.
	Other than that I like:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Fighter Jets</li>
		<li>Tee</li>
		<li>Castles</li>
		<li>Math (or really, anything science related)</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>### Fighter Jets</h3>
	<p class="content">
	Somwhere in the last 2 years, I've developed a love for fighter jets.
	I especially like 5th-gen fighters like the F22 Raptor, 
	though my favourite plane is, of course, the F14 Tomcat.
	</p>		
	<h3>### Tee</h3>
	<p class="content">
	I've found myself drinking a lot of tea recently, and with that, 
	I've also developed some specific tastes. I really enjoy all kinds of black tea, 
	but I also have a soft spot for fruit teas.
	</p>		
	<h3>### Castles</h3>
	<p class="content">
	For a few years now I've been visiting various castles across Europe.
	I usually do so during autumn or winter, those seasons really frame the
	Castles beautifully. And of course, the history of each one is fascinating.
	too.
	</p>		
	<h3>### Math</h3>
	<p class="content">
	This is a more recent development, I've started to get really interested in
	Maths and have since annoyed my math-major friends into explaining everything
	they can to me :D
	</p>
